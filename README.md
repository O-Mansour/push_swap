# PUSH_SWAP
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.

## Overview
I created a program that sorts numbers using two stacks (a and b) and a limited set of operations. The challenge lies in achieving the sort with the fewest moves possible, emphasizing algorithmic thinking and optimization.

## Features
1. Two Stacks: Use two stacks to manage the numbers during sorting.
2. Operations: Implement various operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, and rrr).
3. Sorting Logic: Design and implement a sorting algorithm that minimizes the number of operations.
4. Complexity Analysis: Analyze the complexity of your algorithm and demonstrate efficiency.
